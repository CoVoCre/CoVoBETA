# CoVoBETA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you'll find some useful info, mostly for myself at first.

## Images in react

Either require first like `import logo from "./../../logo.png";'`
Or also just do like `src={"images/logo.png"}` so just the brackets.
[Note] : by default the root will be static, unless ./ used to explicitly reference the file's personal root.
